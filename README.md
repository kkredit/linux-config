# Linux-config

## Purpose

This is a collection of scripts and config files that keep my Linux environment
portable and in sync. It is mostly Ubuntu-oriented.

## Usage

To install config files to appropriate locations on the filesystem,
run

```sh
./file-install.sh [update] [submodules]
```

`update` installs some programs from the web, and `submodules` option
initializes or updates the submodules. Nothing in this script requires root
privileges.

To install programs, run

```sh
./program-install.sh [update | some-prog]
```

`update` runs an `apt-get update/upgrade` sequence and exits. `some-prog` causes
the script to install one or more less-used or more complex program installs,
such as `ruby` for an RVM installation or `wireshark` to install the program and
manage the groups. Running this script requires root privileges.

## File Structure

- `helper_scripts/`: helper bash functions used within this repo
- `reference/`: handy template files, like Makefile templates, a static IP
  interfaces template, etc.
- `submodules/`: cloned submodules
- `system_files/`: config files that get placed around the filesystem, like
  `.bashrc`, `.vimrc`, etc.
- `wsl/`: scripts and files that make sense only in the WSL environment

## Sharing

You are 100% free to use anything from this repo. Please contribute your tips
and tricks as well.

I've considered making this more modular so that it could be easily forked and
shared, but I find that the real value is in making your config your own. Fork
or copy this repo, then tear out my content and replace it with your own as you
build it up over time.
